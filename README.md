# GPGPU Experiments in Rust with ArrayFire

Toying around with / getting to know [arrayfire-rust](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust).
Don't expect anything crazy here. ðŸ™Œ

## Example applications

- [conway.rs](src/conway.rs): GPU-enabled [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) through
  kernel convolutions, taken from the `arrayfire-rust` examples and spiced up for readability and understandability.
  Uses ArrayFire's graphics module to provide a window.
  ```bash
  cargo run
  cargo run --bin conway
  ```

- [trivial.rs](src/trivial.rs): The simple example from the `arrayfire-rust` [README](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust/blob/master/README.md):
  ```bash
  cargo run --bin trivial
  ```
  
- [white_noise.rs](src/white_noise.rs): Just white noise in a window. 
  ```bash
  cargo run --bin white-noise
  ```
  
- [half_precision.rs](src/half_precision.rs): FP16 example using [half::f16](https://docs.rs/half/1.6.0/half/).
  Doesn't work on my GTX 980 Ti (Compute 5.2) with CUDA 10 / driver 450, so the CPU back-end is used instead.
  ```bash
  cargo run --bin half-precision
  ```

- [adaptive_threshold.rs](src/adaptive_threshold.rs): Implements three adaptive thresholding
  techniques (mean, median and min-max average) as described in [Image editing using ArrayFire: Part 3](https://arrayfire.com/image-editing-using-arrayfire-part-3-2/).
  Note that the path to the image is hard-coded, so it needs to be run from the repository root.
  ```bash
  cargo run --bin adaptive-threshold
  ```
  
- [histogram.rs](src/histogram.rs): Implements RGB histogram calculation as described in [Image editing using ArrayFire: Part 3](https://arrayfire.com/image-editing-using-arrayfire-part-3-2/).
   Makes use of `slice()` and/or `index()` to obtain individual channels from an `Array<T>`.
   Note that the path to the image is hard-coded, so it needs to be run from the repository root.
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin histogram
   ```


## Installing ArrayFire

From the [arrayfire-rust](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust) instructions:

> To use the rust bindings for ArrayFire from crates.io, the following requirements are to be met first.
>
>  1. [Download and install ArrayFire binaries](https://arrayfire.com/download) based on your operating system.
>  2. Set the evironment variable `AF_PATH` to point to ArrayFire installation root folder.
>  3. Make sure to add the path to lib files to your path environment variables.
>      - On Linux: do `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$AF_PATH/lib64`
>      - On OSX: do `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$AF_PATH/lib64`
>      - On Windows: Add `%AF_PATH%\lib` to your PATH environment variable.
>  4. Add `arrayfire = "3.7"` to the dependencies section of your project's Cargo.toml file. Make sure
>     to change the version to latest available.
>  
>  Once step (4) is over, you should be able to use ArrayFire in your Rust project.
